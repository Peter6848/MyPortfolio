    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>I love the outdoors and tech.  If i can't adventure somewhere new or learn a new skill i get moody!
      Pushing my capabilites has always kept me seeking new opportunities and has allowed me to meet some really
      cool people along the way.
    </p>

      Everything software related is interesting to me.  I love learning new techniques from talented developers and
      applying them to my own skill set.  I have a passion for creating beautiful and fluid experiences for the user and
      implementing best practices for both the back-end and front-end in any application I put my hands too.
